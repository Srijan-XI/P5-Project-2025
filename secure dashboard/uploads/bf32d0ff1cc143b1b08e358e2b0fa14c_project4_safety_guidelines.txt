SAFETY AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR PROJECT 4
=============================================

BEFORE STARTING:
1. Only test on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
2. Use isolated virtual machines to prevent network interference
3. Disable internet access on target systems
4. Keep detailed logs of all activities

LEGAL COMPLIANCE:
- This project is for educational purposes only
- Do not use these techniques on systems without authorization
- Unauthorized access is illegal in most jurisdictions
- Obtain written permission before testing any system

LAB ISOLATION:
- Use VMware/VirtualBox host-only networks
- Disable NAT/bridged networking on target VMs
- Take snapshots before testing for easy recovery
- Monitor resource usage to prevent system crashes

ETHICAL GUIDELINES:
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly
- Do not access sensitive data beyond what's necessary for testing
- Document findings professionally
- Use knowledge to improve security, not cause harm

WINDOWS FIREWALL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Only disable firewall in controlled lab environment
- Re-enable firewall after testing
- Document the security impact of disabled firewalls
- Test with firewall enabled when possible
